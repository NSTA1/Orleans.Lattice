# Tree Sizing

This document explains how `LatticeOptions` interact with storage provider limits and provides sizing recommendations for each provider.

> **⚠️ Warning:** `MaxLeafKeys` and `MaxInternalChildren` **must not be changed after a tree contains data** without using the `ResizeAsync` API. These options control when nodes split; changing them in configuration alone on an existing tree causes new writes to use different thresholds than the splits that already occurred, leading to nodes that violate the expected size invariants. To safely change these options on a tree that already has data, use [`ResizeAsync`](#resizing-an-existing-tree).

## How Grain State Size Is Determined

Every Lattice grain persists its state as a single serialized blob. The two grains whose state grows with data are:

| Grain | State class | What drives size |
|---|---|---|
| `BPlusLeafGrain` | `LeafNodeState` | `MaxLeafKeys` entries, each a `string` key + `LwwValue<byte[]>` (value bytes, HLC timestamp, tombstone flag) + version vector + sibling pointers |
| `BPlusInternalGrain` | `InternalNodeState` | `MaxInternalChildren` child entries, each a `string?` separator key + `GrainId` |

`ShardRootGrain` state is small and constant-sized — it is not a concern.

### Leaf node: per-entry overhead

Each entry in `LeafNodeState.Entries` is serialized as:

| Component | Type | Approximate serialized size |
|---|---|---|
| Key | `string` | 4 bytes length prefix + UTF-8 bytes |
| Value payload | `byte[]` | 4 bytes length prefix + raw bytes |
| HLC timestamp | `HybridLogicalClock` | 12 bytes (long + int) |
| Tombstone flag | `bool` | 1 byte |
| Orleans serialization framing | — | ~10–20 bytes per entry (field IDs, type headers) |

**Per-entry total ≈ 31 bytes overhead + key bytes + value bytes.**

In addition, the leaf carries fixed-cost fields:

| Field | Approximate size |
|---|---|
| `Clock` (HLC) | 12 bytes |
| `Version` (VersionVector) | ~50–200 bytes (grows with replica count) |
| `LastCompactionVersion` | ~50–200 bytes |
| Sibling pointers (×3) | ~100 bytes each when present |
| Split metadata | ~50 bytes |
| Orleans state envelope | ~100–200 bytes |

**Fixed overhead ≈ 0.5–1 KB.**

### Internal node: per-child overhead

Each `ChildEntry` is:

| Component | Approximate size |
|---|---|
| Separator key (`string?`) | 4 bytes + UTF-8 bytes (null for leftmost) |
| `GrainId` | ~60–80 bytes (type + key) |
| Framing | ~10–15 bytes |

**Per-child total ≈ 80–100 bytes + separator key bytes.**

Fixed overhead for `InternalNodeState` is small (~200 bytes).

## Estimating Maximum Grain State Size

### Leaf grain (worst case)

```
LeafStateSize ≈ 1 KB + MaxLeafKeys × (31 + avgKeySize + avgValueSize)
```

### Internal grain (worst case)

```
InternalStateSize ≈ 200 + MaxInternalChildren × (90 + avgSeparatorKeySize)
```

> **Note:** Tombstoned entries still occupy space until compaction removes them. Between compaction passes, a leaf may contain up to `MaxLeafKeys` tombstoned entries *in addition to* live entries temporarily (during merges), though splits prevent it from exceeding `MaxLeafKeys` total entries at rest.

## Storage Provider Limits

The table below lists the per-grain state size limit for each Orleans storage provider. These limits are **hard caps** — exceeding them causes write failures (exceptions on `WriteStateAsync`).

| Storage Provider | Max state size per grain | Limiting factor |
|---|---|---|
| **Azure Table Storage** | **~960 KB** (see note) | Single entity limit is 1 MB including all property overhead. String properties are limited to 64 KB each, but Orleans stores state as a single binary property. The effective limit after partition key, row key, timestamp, and property overhead is ~960 KB. |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | **~190.7 TiB** (block blob) | Block blob max is approximately 190.7 TiB (50,000 blocks × 4,000 MiB). In practice, serialization/deserialization memory is the real constraint — states above ~50–100 MB become impractical. |
| **Azure Cosmos DB** | **2 MB** | Maximum document size is 2 MB. The Orleans provider stores each grain as a single document. |
| **ADO.NET (SQL Server)** | **~2 GB** | `VARBINARY(MAX)` column. Practical limit is much lower due to memory and query performance — stay well under 10 MB. |
| **ADO.NET (PostgreSQL)** | **~1 GB** | `BYTEA` column. Same practical caveat as SQL Server. |
| **ADO.NET (MySQL)** | **~4 GB** | `LONGBLOB` column. Same practical caveat. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | **400 KB** | Maximum item size is 400 KB. |
| **Memory (dev/test only)** | **Unlimited** | Bounded only by available RAM. Not durable. |
| **Redis** | **512 MB** | Max value size. Practical limit is much lower. |

> **Important — Azure Table Storage:** Although the Azure Table entity size limit is often cited as 1 MB, the effective payload capacity depends on how the Orleans provider encodes state. The `Orleans.Persistence.AzureStorage` provider stores grain state in a single binary property. After accounting for partition key, row key, ETag, and timestamp properties, approximately **960 KB** is available for the serialized grain state. For safety, plan for a **900 KB** usable budget.

> **Important — Cosmos DB:** The 2 MB document limit is *total* including Cosmos DB system properties (`_rid`, `_ts`, `_etag`, etc.) and the Orleans metadata envelope. Budget approximately **1.9 MB** for actual grain state.

## Sizing Recommendations by Provider

### Azure Table Storage (limit: ~900 KB usable)

This is the most constrained common provider. Size your nodes conservatively.

**Formula to check fit:**

```
MaxLeafKeys × (31 + avgKeySize + avgValueSize) + 1024 < 900 KB (921,600 bytes)
```

| Scenario | Avg key | Avg value | Recommended `MaxLeafKeys` | Estimated max leaf size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small values (UUIDs + flags) | 36 B | 8 B | 512 | ~39 KB ✅ |
| Medium values (IDs + JSON) | 50 B | 500 B | 512 | ~298 KB ✅ |
| Large values (IDs + documents) | 50 B | 2 KB | 256 | ~533 KB ✅ |
| Very large values (blobs) | 50 B | 4 KB | 128 | ~524 KB ✅ |
| Oversized values | 50 B | 8 KB | 64 | ~517 KB ✅ |
| Huge values | 50 B | 16 KB | 32 | ~515 KB ✅ |

**Internal nodes** are rarely a concern for Table Storage. With `MaxInternalChildren = 128` and average separator keys of 50 bytes, an internal node is only ~18 KB.

**Recommendation:** For Table Storage, keep `MaxLeafKeys` × average entry size well under 900 KB. The default of 128 is safe for values up to ~6 KB. If your values exceed 4 KB, reduce `MaxLeafKeys` proportionally. If individual values approach 8 KB+, consider storing them in Blob Storage and keeping only a reference in the tree.

### Azure Blob Storage (limit: ~50 MB practical)

Blob Storage has an enormous theoretical limit but serialization cost and memory pressure during `ReadStateAsync` / `WriteStateAsync` make very large states impractical.

| Scenario | Avg key | Avg value | Recommended `MaxLeafKeys` | Estimated max leaf size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small values | 36 B | 8 B | 1,024 | ~77 KB |
| Medium values | 50 B | 500 B | 1,024 | ~596 KB |
| Large values | 50 B | 4 KB | 512 | ~2 MB |
| Very large values | 50 B | 16 KB | 256 | ~4 MB |

**Recommendation:** Blob Storage is the most forgiving provider. The defaults (128) are very conservative here. You can safely increase `MaxLeafKeys` to 512–1,024 for better fan-out and fewer grains, as long as total leaf size stays under ~10 MB for comfortable performance.

### Azure Cosmos DB (limit: ~1.9 MB usable)

| Scenario | Avg key | Avg value | Recommended `MaxLeafKeys` | Estimated max leaf size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small values | 36 B | 8 B | 1,024 | ~77 KB ✅ |
| Medium values | 50 B | 500 B | 1,024 | ~596 KB ✅ |
| Large values | 50 B | 2 KB | 512 | ~1.0 MB ✅ |
| Very large values | 50 B | 4 KB | 256 | ~1.0 MB ✅ |

**Recommendation:** The default of 128 is safe for all typical workloads. You can increase to 256–512 for small-to-medium values. Avoid exceeding 1,024 unless values are tiny. Watch for the 2 MB boundary — leave at least 100 KB headroom.

### Amazon DynamoDB (limit: 400 KB)

This is the **most restrictive** provider. Plan very carefully.

```
MaxLeafKeys × (31 + avgKeySize + avgValueSize) + 1024 < 380 KB (389,120 bytes)
```

| Scenario | Avg key | Avg value | Recommended `MaxLeafKeys` | Estimated max leaf size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small values | 36 B | 8 B | 512 | ~39 KB ✅ |
| Medium values | 50 B | 500 B | 256 | ~149 KB ✅ |
| Large values | 50 B | 2 KB | 128 | ~267 KB ✅ |
| Very large values | 50 B | 4 KB | 64 | ~262 KB ✅ |

**Recommendation:** For DynamoDB, reduce `MaxLeafKeys` aggressively for larger values. The default of 128 works for values up to ~2 KB. For larger values, drop to 64 or 32. Internal nodes with the default `MaxInternalChildren = 128` are fine (~18 KB).

### ADO.NET / SQL (limit: practical ~10 MB)

Relational providers have very large theoretical limits but performance degrades with large binary columns.

**Recommendation:** Treat as similar to Blob Storage. The defaults are conservative and safe. You can increase `MaxLeafKeys` to 512–1,024 for small values. Keep total leaf state under 5–10 MB for responsive queries.

### Redis (limit: practical ~5 MB)

**Recommendation:** Similar to Blob Storage but with tighter practical limits due to single-threaded processing. Keep leaf state under 1–2 MB for responsive operations. Defaults are safe.

## Default Configuration Assessment

The defaults (`MaxLeafKeys = 128`, `MaxInternalChildren = 128`) were chosen conservatively:

| Provider | Default safe? | Maximum average value size at defaults |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Table Storage | ✅ Yes | ~6.7 KB per value |
| Azure Blob Storage | ✅ Yes | Effectively unlimited |
| Azure Cosmos DB | ✅ Yes | ~14 KB per value |
| Amazon DynamoDB | ✅ Yes | ~2.7 KB per value |
| ADO.NET (any) | ✅ Yes | Effectively unlimited |
| Redis | ✅ Yes | Effectively unlimited |
| Memory | ✅ Yes | Bounded by RAM |

The defaults are safe for **all providers** with values up to ~2.5 KB — covering most typical use cases (JSON documents, serialized DTOs, small binary payloads).

## Calculating Your Limits

Use this formula to determine the maximum `MaxLeafKeys` for your workload:

```
MaxLeafKeys = floor((ProviderLimit - 1024) / (31 + avgKeySize + avgValueSize))
```

Where:
- `ProviderLimit` is the usable provider limit in bytes (e.g., 921,600 for Table Storage)
- `avgKeySize` is the average key length in bytes (UTF-8 encoded)
- `avgValueSize` is the average value length in bytes
- `1024` accounts for fixed leaf overhead
- `31` accounts for per-entry serialization overhead

**Example:** Azure Table Storage with 100-byte keys and 1 KB values:

```
MaxLeafKeys = floor((921,600 - 1,024) / (31 + 100 + 1,024)) = floor(920,576 / 1,155) = 797
```

Apply a **25% safety margin** (for tombstones, version vector growth, and serialization variance):

```
SafeMaxLeafKeys = floor(797 × 0.75) = 597
```

## Internal Node Sizing

Internal nodes are much smaller than leaf nodes because they only store separator keys and `GrainId` references — no values. The formula is:

```
InternalStateSize ≈ 200 + MaxInternalChildren × (90 + avgSeparatorKeySize)
```

With the default `MaxInternalChildren = 128` and 50-byte separator keys:

```
InternalStateSize ≈ 200 + 128 × 140 = ~18 KB
```

This fits comfortably within **all** storage providers, including DynamoDB (400 KB). You would need separator keys averaging over 2 KB *and* `MaxInternalChildren` over 128 before internal nodes become a sizing concern. In practice, **you do not need to tune `MaxInternalChildren` for storage limits** — only for tree depth vs. fan-out trade-offs.

## Key Trade-Offs

| Direction | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Increase `MaxLeafKeys`** | Fewer grains, shallower tree, fewer splits, larger state per grain, higher risk of hitting provider limits, more data transferred per `ReadStateAsync`/`WriteStateAsync` |
| **Decrease `MaxLeafKeys`** | More grains, deeper tree, more splits, smaller state per grain, well within provider limits, faster individual reads/writes |
| **Increase `MaxInternalChildren`** | Shallower tree, fewer routing hops, slightly larger internal state (rarely a problem) |
| **Decrease `MaxInternalChildren`** | Deeper tree, more routing hops, smaller internal state |

## Resizing an Existing Tree

If you need to change `MaxLeafKeys` or `MaxInternalChildren` on a tree that already contains data, use the `ResizeAsync` API:

```csharp
var tree = grainFactory.GetGrain<ILattice>("my-tree");
await tree.ResizeAsync(newMaxLeafKeys: 256, newMaxInternalChildren: 64);
```

### How it works

Resize uses an **offline snapshot** to create a new physical tree with the desired sizing, then swaps the tree alias so reads and writes are redirected:

1. **Snapshot** — An offline snapshot is taken of the current physical tree into a new physical tree (e.g., `my-tree/resized/{opId}`). The snapshot uses the new `MaxLeafKeys` and `MaxInternalChildren` values. During this phase, the source tree is locked (all shards marked as deleted).
2. **Swap** — The tree alias is set so the logical tree ID (`my-tree`) points to the new physical tree. The registry entry is updated with the new sizing. After this point, new `LatticeGrain` activations will resolve the alias and route to the new tree.
3. **Cleanup** — The old physical tree is soft-deleted. It will be purged automatically after the configured `SoftDeleteDuration` (default 72 hours).

Each phase transition is persisted. If the silo crashes mid-resize, a keepalive reminder reactivates the grain and resumes from the last completed phase.

### Cache invalidation

Different physical trees produce different leaf grain IDs, which automatically create fresh `LeafCacheGrain` instances. No explicit cache flush is needed after the alias swap. See [Read Caching](caching.md#cache-invalidation-via-tree-aliasing) for details.

### Undo resize

During the soft-delete window, the resize can be undone:

```csharp
var tree = grainFactory.GetGrain<ILattice>("my-tree");
await tree.UndoResizeAsync();
```

This recovers the old physical tree, removes the alias, and deletes the new snapshot tree. After the soft-delete window expires and the old tree is purged, the resize can no longer be undone.

### Important considerations

- **Availability:** During the snapshot phase, the source tree is locked (offline snapshot). Once the alias is swapped, the tree is immediately available with the new sizing. Stale `LatticeGrain` activations may briefly route to the soft-deleted old tree and throw `InvalidOperationException`; client retries will hit new activations that resolve the updated alias.
- **Storage:** Both the old and new physical trees exist simultaneously until the old tree is purged. Plan for approximately 2× the tree's storage usage during this window.
- **Idempotency:** Calling `ResizeAsync` again with the same parameters while a resize is in progress is a no-op. Calling with different parameters throws `InvalidOperationException`.
- **Options configuration:** The new sizing values are stored in the tree registry and take priority over `IOptionsMonitor` configuration. You do not need to update your silo configuration separately.
- **`ShardCount` cannot be resized.** Changing shard count requires re-hashing all keys, which `ResizeAsync` does not support. Choose shard count before first use.

### Manual trigger (testing)

For integration tests or manual operations, use the `ITreeResizeGrain` directly:

```csharp
var resize = grainFactory.GetGrain<ITreeResizeGrain>("my-tree");
await resize.ResizeAsync(256, 64);
await resize.RunResizePassAsync(); // synchronous — processes all phases in one call
```

## Summary

1. **Know your storage provider's hard limit** before tuning options.
2. **Estimate your average entry size** (key + value + 31 bytes overhead).
3. **Apply the formula** with a 25% safety margin.
4. **DynamoDB and Table Storage** are the most constrained — always verify fit.
5. **The defaults are safe for all providers** when values are under ~2.5 KB.
6. **Internal nodes rarely need tuning** for storage limits — only for depth trade-offs.
7. **Monitor grain state sizes** in production — tombstones, version vector growth, and value size variance can push actual sizes above estimates.
