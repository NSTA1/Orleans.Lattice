# Chaos Tests

Orleans.Lattice ships a suite of integration tests that bombard a running
cluster with concurrent reads, writes, scans, and topology mutations,
then assert that the system's public correctness guarantees hold. They
act as the end-to-end contract for the properties described in
[Consistency](consistency.md) — specifically that the public `ILattice`
API is strongly consistent across arbitrary concurrent shard splits,
online resizes, and online reshards — and that the recovery protocols
(resumable splits, two-phase root promotion, shadow-write atomicity,
shadow-forwarding, registry version stamping, idempotent bulk graft)
converge correctly even when storage writes fail at random.

All chaos tests live under `test/lattice/BPlusTree/`, use the
`[NonParallelizable]` attribute so they have the cluster to themselves,
and are tagged `[Category("Chaos")]` so the iterative-development test
filter (`dotnet test --filter "TestCategory!=Chaos"`) skips them.

| Test class | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Happy-path chaos | `ChaosIntegrationTests.cs` | Strong invariants *during* heavy concurrent load with manually-triggered splits. |
| Chaos + storage faults | `ChaosWithFaultsIntegrationTests.cs` | Parametrized theory that injects random storage faults; asserts eventual convergence after the fault window closes. |
| Chaos + online resize | `ChaosResizeIntegrationTests.cs` | Full-workload chaos while `ResizeAsync` changes fan-out in the background under `SnapshotMode.Online`. Exercises the `TreeResizeGrain` phase machine (Snapshot → Swap → Reject → Cleanup), shadow-forwarding on every source shard, and the alias swap. |
| Chaos + online reshard | `ChaosReshardIntegrationTests.cs` | Full-workload chaos while `ReshardAsync` grows the physical shard count (4 → 8) in the background. Exercises the `TreeReshardGrain` migration loop, dispatch-budget clamping, `HotShardMonitorGrain` interlock, and `ShardMap` convergence when reshard-dispatched splits race with workload writes. |
| Atomic-write reader isolation | `AtomicVisibilityChaosTests.cs` | Strict reader isolation: a continuous reader concurrent with `SetManyAtomicAsync` always observes either the full pre-saga snapshot, the full post-saga snapshot, or all keys hidden — never a partial view. |
| Digest determinism under load | `ChaosDigestIntegrationTests.cs` | `ILattice.GetLeafProjectionDigestAsync` is byte-stable across repeated calls in a write-quiescent window after concurrent writer / scanner load, and per-shard `EntryCount` sums equal `CountAsync`. |

## The workload

Every chaos test runs a parallel workload against a 4-shard tree with
aggressive structural sizing (`MaxLeafKeys = 4` on the happy-path /
faults fixtures) over a fixed key *universe*. Writers only rewrite
existing keys with monotonically-increasing values of the form
`v-{keyIndex}-{writerId}-{seq}`. Any value matching that envelope proves
the byte array is internally consistent.

Fixture and parameter differences:

| Test | Fixture | `MaxLeafKeys` | `MaxInternalChildren` | Key prefix | Universe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Happy-path | `FourShardClusterFixture` | 4 | default | `chaos-{i:D5}` | 500 |
| Chaos + faults | `MultiShardFaultInjectionClusterFixture` | 4 | 4 | `fchaos-{i:D5}` | 200 |
| Chaos + resize | `FourShardClusterFixture` | registry default → `16` mid-run | registry default → `16` mid-run | `resize-chaos-{i:D5}` | 200 |
| Chaos + reshard | `FourShardClusterFixture` (4 shards → 8) | registry default | registry default | `reshard-chaos-{i:D5}` | 200 |

Worker categories (exact mix varies per test — see the runtime table):

* **Point writers** — `SetAsync` on random universe keys.
* **Bulk writers** — `SetManyAsync` with batches of 8 random keys
  (happy-path / faults only).
* **Point readers** — `GetAsync`; validates envelope if a value is returned.
* **Bulk readers** — `GetManyAsync` for 16 random keys (happy-path /
  faults only).
* **Scanners** — rotating `ScanKeysAsync`, `ScanEntriesAsync`, reverse scan,
  range scan. Each full-tree scan must yield exactly the universe with
  no duplicates and no unknown keys.
* **Counters** — `CountAsync` must always equal the pinned universe size.
* **Topology mutator** — test-specific:
  * happy-path: every ~500 ms drives
    `ITreeShardSplitGrain.SplitAsync` + `RunSplitPassAsync` on a
    non-empty shard.
  * faults: same split driver plus a fault injector that arms random
    `WriteStateAsync` faults.
  * resize: initiates `ResizeAsync` once at the window start and pumps
    the coordinator to completion.
  * reshard: initiates `ReshardAsync(8)` once at the window start and
    pumps `RunReshardPassAsync` + per-shard split passes to completion.

## Test 1 — Happy-path chaos (`ChaosIntegrationTests`)

This test establishes that `ILattice`'s consistency guarantees hold
*during* the chaos window, not just after it closes. Every operation
observes a fully consistent view of the tree.

### What it proves

| Invariant | Mechanism under test |
|---|---|
| `CountAsync` returns the exact universe size, always | Per-slot routing via `CountForSlotsAsync` against the authoritative `ShardMap` plus version stability check |
| `ScanKeysAsync` / `ScanEntriesAsync` yield exactly the universe, no duplicates, no unknowns, in strict sorted order | In-line reconciliation-cursor injection into the k-way merge + `HashSet` dedup |
| `ScanKeysAsync(null, null, reverse: true)` yields the full universe in reverse | Reverse-scan path also reconciles |
| `ScanKeysAsync(start, end)` yields exactly the in-range slice | Range pruning is slot-aware |
| `GetAsync` / `GetManyAsync` never return a corrupt value | Writes are atomic per-shard; CRDT LWW resolves concurrent rewrites |
| No public-API call throws an unhandled exception | Stale routing retries and enumeration aborts are transparent |
| Splits during a scan never cause data loss, duplication, or out-of-order output | `MovedAwaySlots` + version stamping + in-line reconciliation |

### Tolerated transients

These exception types surface from Orleans' streaming internals and are
treated as retry signals, not failures:

* `EnumerationAbortedException` — a stream cursor grain deactivated
  mid-iteration. The caller re-issues the scan.
* `StaleShardRoutingException` — a `LatticeGrain` activation used a
  cached shard map after a concurrent split committed its swap. The
  framework retries once against the fresh map.

Any other exception, or any observed envelope/duplicate/missing-key
violation, fails the test.

### Pass criteria

After the chaos window closes:

* `CountAsync` matches the pinned universe size exactly.
* `ScanKeysAsync` yields exactly the pinned universe (no gaps, no extras).
* Every worker category performed at least one operation (proves the
  workload ran under real concurrency, not a degenerate single-thread
  schedule).
* Zero envelope violations were observed *during* the window.

## Test 2 — Chaos + storage faults theory (`ChaosWithFaultsIntegrationTests`)

This parametrized theory layers random storage faults on top of the same
workload. Unlike the happy-path test, per-operation invariants are
*weakened* during the fault window — arbitrary exceptions are tolerated
because a failed `WriteStateAsync` legitimately cascades into split
aborts, stale routing, and count drift. Instead, the test asserts
**eventual convergence**: once faults stop and the cluster quiesces,
the tree must recover to the exact same pinned universe with every
value still matching its envelope.

`faultProbability` is the probability, per 20 ms tick, that the fault
injector arms a fresh one-shot `WriteStateAsync` fault on a randomly
chosen target grain (initial leaves + shard-root grains of every shard).
Orleans' `FaultInjectionGrainStorage` consumes each armed fault on the
next write for that grain, so the injector re-arms continuously to
approximate a steady-state failure rate.

> Note: Orleans' one-shot fault API caps concurrent armed faults at
> ≈ `|targets|`. Higher `faultProbability` primarily drives faster
> re-arm latency rather than a linear increase in fault count. The
> gradient is still meaningful for exercising recovery paths under
> progressively heavier disruption.

### Test phases

    Test->>Tree: Seed universe (faults off)
    Test->>Injector: Start at p=faultProbability

    Test->>Tree: DrainAndHealAsync (up to 15 s)
    Note over Tree: retry writes over universe<br/>until 3 consecutive clean passes
    Test->>Tree: Assert strong invariants
```

### Tolerated during faults

Every exception type is tolerated and counted (`tolerated-write-errors`,
`tolerated-read-errors`, `tolerated-scan-errors`, etc.). A single
storage fault cascades into many observable shapes:

* Direct `InvalidOperationException` from the faulted write.
* `OrleansException` wrappers when a faulted grain deactivates.
* `EnumerationAbortedException` if a stream cursor was on the
  deactivated grain.
* `StaleShardRoutingException` after a shard map swap when the split
  coordinator crashed and resumed mid-phase.
* `ArgumentException` from the injector itself when a target already
  has an armed fault pending (skipped).

Envelope violations (a value that doesn't start with `v-{index}-`) are
**not** tolerated — CRDT LWW is supposed to preserve atomicity of the
value payload even when the wrapping write fails.

### Healing phase (`DrainAndHealAsync`)

After the fault injector stops, lingering armed faults remain on
whichever targets weren't hit during the chaos window. The test drains
them by replaying writes over the entire universe until **3 consecutive
passes complete exception-free**, bounded by a 15 s timeout. This loop:

* Consumes any remaining one-shot faults (each fires once on its next
  write, clearing itself).
* Gives resumable splits and pending root promotions time to reach
  their `RunSplitPassAsync` keepalive tick and replay.
* Exercises idempotent apply of `BulkGraft` and shadow `MergeManyAsync`
  — a healing retry that re-writes the same value is a no-op under LWW.

### Pass criteria (post-quiescence)

After healing:

* `CountAsync == UniverseSize` exactly.
* `ScanKeysAsync` yields exactly the pinned universe.
* `ScanEntriesAsync` yields exactly the pinned universe with every value
  matching its envelope.
* Every universe key is recoverable via `GetAsync`.
* Zero envelope violations were observed during the whole run.
* Every workload category performed at least one operation; the
  injector armed at least one fault (for `p > 0`).

## Test 3 — Chaos + online resize (`ChaosResizeIntegrationTests`)

This test targets the online resize path. A full concurrent workload
runs against a seeded tree while `ResizeAsync` changes the B+ fan-out
to `MaxLeafKeys = 16` / `MaxInternalChildren = 16` under
`SnapshotMode.Online`. The entire resize — snapshot drain, alias swap,
per-shard reject phase, cleanup — happens inside the chaos window.

### Recovery surfaces exercised

* `TreeResizeGrain` phase machine (Snapshot → Swap → Reject → Cleanup)
  under sustained traffic.
* Shadow-forwarding on every source shard — live writes during the
  drain must be mirrored to the destination with their original HLCs.
* Alias swap — mid-flight `GetAsync` / `SetAsync` on a stateless-worker
  `LatticeGrain` activation holding a stale alias must transparently
  re-resolve and retry.
* Strongly-consistent `CountAsync` / `ScanKeysAsync` during the online
  snapshot drain and Rejecting phase.

### Tolerated transients

The same set as the happy-path test, plus `StaleTreeRoutingException`
raised during the alias swap window.

### Pass criteria

After the chaos window closes:

* `CountAsync` matches the pinned universe size exactly.
* `ScanKeysAsync` yields exactly the pinned universe.
* `IsResizeCompleteAsync` is `true`.
* Every worker category performed at least one operation; the resize
  was driven to completion.
* Zero envelope violations observed during the window.

## Test 4 — Chaos + online reshard (`ChaosReshardIntegrationTests`)

This test targets the online reshard path — growing the physical shard
count from 4 to 8 while the tree continues to serve traffic. The
reshard is kicked off synchronously before the chaos timer starts (so
cold-activation cost doesn't burn the window on slow Release CI
runners); the in-window driver only pumps the migration loop to
completion.

### Recovery surfaces exercised

* `TreeReshardGrain` migration loop under sustained traffic —
  eligibility filtering, dispatch-budget clamping
  (`MaxConcurrentMigrations`), re-evaluation across ticks.
* `HotShardMonitorGrain` interlock — the autonomic monitor must
  suppress its own passes while a reshard is in flight.
* `ShardMap` convergence when reshard-dispatched splits race with
  workload writes (shadow-write, drain, swap, reject, permanent
  `MovedAwaySlots`).
* No invariant drift across the full reshard window.

### Tolerated transients

`EnumerationAbortedException`, `StaleShardRoutingException`,
`TimeoutException`.

### Pass criteria

After the chaos window closes:

* `CountAsync` matches the pinned universe size exactly.
* `ScanKeysAsync` yields exactly the pinned universe.
* `IsReshardCompleteAsync` is `true`.
* The post-reshard `ShardMap` has at least `ReshardTarget` distinct
  physical shards.
* Every worker category performed at least one operation.
* Zero envelope violations observed during the window.

## Test 5 — Atomic-write reader isolation (`AtomicVisibilityChaosTests`)

This test asserts the **universal reader-isolation invariant** for
`SetManyAtomicAsync`: every poll of a continuous reader concurrent
with an in-flight saga must observe either the full pre-saga snapshot,
the full post-saga snapshot, or all keys hidden — never a partial view.
The invariant holds **per poll**, with no bounded-window caveat, across
50 sequential saga rounds at a 10 ms reader cadence.

### What it proves

| Invariant | Mechanism under test |
|---|---|
| Continuous reader observes zero-or-all keys at every poll | WAL-metadata reader-isolation primitive driven through `BPlusLeafGrain`'s prepared-write commit path |
| Saga drives 16 keys spanning multiple leaves through the full prepare → terminal pipeline | `AtomicWriteGrain` per-shard terminal broadcast, idempotent under concurrent retry |
| Final post-round value is preserved across 50 iterations | LWW resolution under saga commit ordering |

### Workload

* **Seed phase** — `SetAsync` for each of 16 keys (`atomic-00` … `atomic-15`) at round 0, followed by a single `SetManyAtomicAsync` at round 0 to land all keys through the saga path before reader rounds begin.
* **Saga rounds** — 50 sequential rounds. Each round starts a continuous reader task that polls all 16 keys via `GetManyAsync` every 10 ms, and concurrently issues `SetManyAtomicAsync` with the post-round value envelope.
* **Reader classification** — every poll is bucketed: `fullPre` (every key at the previous round's value), `fullPost` (every key at the new round's value), `fullHidden` (every key missing during the prepare → terminal window), or **split** (any mixed observation, which fails the test).

### Pass criteria

* Zero split-view failures across all 50 rounds.
* `totalPolls > 0` and `fullPostPolls > 0` (proves the reader and saga ran under real concurrency).
* Final `GetManyAsync` of all 16 keys yields the round-50 envelope on every key.

### Tolerated transients

The reader's `GetManyAsync` may observe `OperationCanceledException` at the round boundary; saga writes are not expected to surface any transient — the saga's own retry-on-stale-routing logic absorbs split / resize / reshard activity at the API layer.

### Companion observability

The `orleans.lattice.atomic_write.duration` (`Histogram<double>`, ms) and `orleans.lattice.atomic_write.batch_size` (`Histogram<int>`, `{entry}`) instruments are emitted on every saga terminal transition tagged `outcome=committed` / `compensated` / `failed`; pair them with `orleans.lattice.atomic_write.completed` to derive saga ops/sec and SLO percentiles when this fixture is run repeatedly. See [Metrics](metrics.md#saga--coordinator--lifecycle).

## Test 6 — Digest determinism under load (`ChaosDigestIntegrationTests`)

This test exercises `ILattice.GetLeafProjectionDigestAsync` under
sustained concurrent load and asserts two determinism invariants that
gate the digest's value as a cross-silo divergence detector:
**byte-identical repeated calls** in a write-quiescent window, and
**per-shard `EntryCount` sums equal `CountAsync`**.

### What it proves

| Invariant | Mechanism under test |
|---|---|
| Digest hash is byte-stable across repeated calls when no writes occur in between | Hash function fed by a deterministically-ordered key+value enumeration over the leaf projection |
| Sum of per-shard `EntryCount` equals `CountAsync` | Shard-level digest counts are accountable against the tree's own population view |
| Digest computation is safe to call concurrently with foreground writer / scanner traffic | No exception is observed on any worker — digest rendering does not block or interfere with the read / write path |

### Workload

* **Seed phase** — 200 keys (`chaos-digest-{i:D5}`) preloaded with `SetAsync`.
* **Chaos window (~8 s)** — 4 writer tasks rewriting random keys, 2 scanner tasks calling `KeysAsync`, 1 digest poller calling `GetLeafProjectionDigestAsync` for every shard in a tight loop.
* **Quiesce phase** — after the chaos window closes, the digest is sampled twice in succession with no intervening writes.

### Pass criteria

* No exception observed on any worker during the chaos window (`EnumerationAbortedException` is tolerated on the scanner; everything else is fatal).
* For every shard, `secondPass[s].Hash` equals `firstPass[s].Hash` and `EntryCount` is equal.
* Sum of `firstPass[s].EntryCount` equals `tree.CountAsync()`.
* `tree.CountAsync()` equals 200 (writers only update existing keys; no inserts or deletes).

### Tolerated transients

* `EnumerationAbortedException` from the scanner's `KeysAsync` enumeration when a stream cursor grain deactivates mid-iteration.
